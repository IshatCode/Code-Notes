Buffer = A buffer is the text content of a file in Atom. It’s basically the same as a file for most descriptions, but it’s the version Atom has in memory. For instance, you can change the text of a buffer and it isn’t written to its associated file until you save it.

Pane = A pane is a visual section of Atom. If you look at the welcome screen we just launched, you can see four Panes - the tab bar, the gutter (which has line numbers in it), the status bar at the bottom and finally the text editor.
